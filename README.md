## EssentialMVVM 

EssentialMVVM is a lightweight  Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) framework for WPF. 

Even some of the most lightweight of MVVM frameworks have become bloated over time, with plenty of external dependencies and features that are not required for many WPF MVVM projects. The aim of this project is to provide a single library for use in WPF applications, with just the essential MVVM components and nothing more!
